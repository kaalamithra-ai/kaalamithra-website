Based on your roadmap (Phases 1 → 5) and everything you’ve already done/pushed, here’s what’s **done vs pending**:

---

## ✅ Completed

* **Phase 1 – Foundation Setup**
  ✔️ Project scaffold with Next.js, Tailwind, ESLint
  ✔️ Global styles working (`globals.css`, `tailwind.config.js`)
  ✔️ Repo synced to GitHub

* **Phase 2 – Core Pages**
  ✔️ Home page (Hero, Features, Testimonials, CTA)
  ✔️ Services (index + dynamic detail pages)
  ✔️ Portfolio (index + dynamic case studies)
  ✔️ Blog (index + dynamic posts via JSON)
  ✔️ About Us, Careers, Contact (with form + success)
  ✔️ 404 custom page

## ⏳ Pending

### Phase 4 (still to finish)

1. **Image optimization**

   * Replace static `<img>` or background images with Next.js `<Image />` where real project/blog images are used.
   * Right now, portfolio/blog images are placeholders → need real assets.

2. **Performance checks**

   * Run `npm run build` locally to check for bundle size warnings.
   * Lazy-load heavy sections if needed (not urgent yet).

3. **SEO fine-tuning**

   * Add per-page SEO overrides (e.g., Services detail pages, Blog posts).

4. **Environment variables**

   * Ensure `.env.local` has `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID` set for deployment.

---

### Phase 5 (not started yet)

1. **UI polish / branding**

   * Finalize color scheme (brand blues, grays).
   * Typography consistency (headings, body text).
   * Check responsive design on mobile + tablet.

2. **Footer final polish**

   * Double-check social links (LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub) actually point to real URLs.

3. **Deployment readiness**

   * Set up Vercel project and connect to GitHub repo.
   * Configure `next-sitemap` for sitemap.xml + robots.txt.

4. **QA pass**

   * Test all routes (About, Services, Portfolio, Blog, Careers, Contact, 404).
   * Test forms, links, navigation.

5. **Production deploy**

   * Deploy to Vercel and test live build.

---

👉 So in short:

* You’ve completed **Phases 1–3 fully**.
* You’ve **started Phase 4**, but need to finish optimization (images, SEO details, build checks).
* **Phase 5 polish + deployment** is still left.
